# Manual Integration Test Checklist

Pre-release validation. Every item must pass before merging to main or tagging a release.

## Prerequisites

- Device flashed with the build under test (USB or OTA)
- Device connected to WiFi and reachable at its hostname (e.g. `test-silvia2.lan`)
- Serial monitor available (USB) **or** telnet client for WiFi logging

## 1. Build & Unit Tests

- [ ] `pio run -e esp32_usb` — firmware compiles without errors
- [ ] `pio test -e native_test` — all native tests pass (280/280 or current count)
- [ ] `pio run --target format -e esp32_usb` — no formatting changes

## 2. OTA Update

- [ ] `pio run -e esp32_ota -t upload` completes at 100% with "Result: OK"
- [ ] Device reboots and responds to `/api/health` within 15s after OTA

## 3. USB Serial Logging

- [ ] `pio device monitor -e esp32_usb` shows boot log lines (WiFi connect, state transitions)
- [ ] Log lines appear at INFO level during normal operation (e.g. temperature readings, state changes)
- [ ] Log level filtering works (DEBUG messages hidden at INFO level)

## 4. WiFi Telnet Logging

- [ ] `nc <hostname> 23` connects and shows "CleverCoffee log stream connected"
- [ ] Log lines appear when activity occurs (API calls, state changes)
- [ ] Idle machine at INFO level = quiet telnet is expected (not a bug)
- [ ] Telnet disconnect/reconnect works cleanly

## 5. Web API Endpoints

Test each with `curl -s http://<hostname>/<endpoint>` and verify non-empty valid JSON response:

- [ ] `GET /api/health` — HTTP 200
- [ ] `GET /api/status` — JSON with temperature, setpoint, machineState, uptime
- [ ] `GET /api/parameters?filter=all` — full parameter list (~19KB JSON array)
- [ ] `GET /api/config` — current config JSON
- [ ] `GET /api/history` — temperature history with currentTemps/targetTemps/heaterPowers arrays
- [ ] `GET /api/temperatures` — current temperature reading
- [ ] `GET /api/nvs-debug` — NVS metadata and parameters

## 6. Web UI

- [ ] `GET /ui/` — serves SPA (HTTP 200, HTML content)
- [ ] `GET /ui/config/behavior` — serves SPA (HTTP 200)
- [ ] UI loads fully in browser without console errors
- [ ] UI displays current temperature and machine state

## 7. Concurrent Load (Telnet + API)

This tests the critical OOM scenario that caused crashes.

- [ ] Connect telnet: `nc <hostname> 23`
- [ ] With telnet open, load UI page in browser — device must not crash
- [ ] With telnet open, hit 5+ API endpoints in rapid succession — all return HTTP 200
- [ ] After load burst, `/api/health` still responds with HTTP 200
- [ ] Repeat after fresh reboot (boot window is the most fragile period)

## 8. Stability

- [ ] Device does not crash/reboot during 5 minutes of idle operation
- [ ] No `abort()`, watchdog reset, or stack overflow in serial output
- [ ] Free heap stays above 50KB during normal operation (`/api/nvs-debug` → `free_heap` field)

## 9. Temperature Sensor Robustness (TSIC)

A single out-of-range TSIC sample must never trip emergency stop or flood the log.

- [ ] During idle/heating, logs do NOT continuously repeat `Temperature not stable`
      (the change-rate stabilisation must latch within the first few readings)
- [ ] A transient bad reading is logged once as `Temperature reading out of range, ignoring: …`
      and does NOT produce an `Emergency: Invalid temperature reading` entry
- [ ] If emergency does trigger (sustained overtemp/fault), recovery returns to
      `PID Normal` (state 20), not `PID disabled` — see ADR 0002 / emergency recovery fix

## 10. Water Tank Sensor, Pump Safety & MQTT/Home Assistant Export

- [ ] With `hardware.sensors.watertank.enabled=true` and the sensor disconnected/dry,
      the machine transitions to `Water Tank Empty` state and the pump refuses to
      start (`Cannot enable pump - water tank is empty` in logs)
- [ ] If the pump was running when the tank goes empty, it stops immediately
      (`Water tank is empty - pump operations disabled` in logs)
- [ ] With `hardware.sensors.watertank.keep_heater_on_empty=false` (default), the
      heater/PID turns off when the tank goes empty
- [ ] With `hardware.sensors.watertank.keep_heater_on_empty=true`, the heater/PID
      continues to run (temperature keeps climbing toward setpoint) while the tank
      is empty; brewing/hot water/backflush remain blocked (pump still can't run)
- [ ] Refilling the tank logs `Water tank refilled - pump operations enabled` and
      the machine returns to its previous PID state
- [ ] With `keep_heater_on_empty=true` and standby enabled, leaving the tank empty
      past the standby timeout moves the machine to `Standby` and turns the heater
      off — the heater must never run unattended indefinitely
- [ ] A standby request (power switch/MQTT) is honored while in `Water Tank Empty`
- [ ] Removing the tank while the machine is in `Standby` does NOT wake it up
      (it stays in standby with the heater off)
- [ ] With a Home Assistant instance subscribed to the MQTT discovery prefix, a
      "Water Tank Full" binary_sensor entity appears (on when full, off when empty;
      not classified as a moisture/leak sensor) after connecting with
      `hardware.sensors.watertank.enabled=true`
- [ ] `mosquitto_sub -t '<prefix>/<hostname>/waterTankFull'` reports `ON` when full
      and `OFF` when empty; the message is retained, so a fresh subscriber (or a
      restarted Home Assistant) receives the current state immediately

## 11. Frontend (when `ui/` files changed)

Run from `ui/packages/frontend`:

- [ ] `pnpm test:run` — all frontend tests pass
- [ ] `pnpm tsc` — no TypeScript errors

Run from `ui/`:

- [ ] `pnpm lint` — Biome lint and format check pass

---

## Quick Smoke Test (minimum for non-release changes)

If the full checklist is too heavy for a minor change, at least verify:

1. Build passes
2. Native tests pass
3. `/api/health` responds 200
4. `/api/parameters?filter=all` returns full JSON
5. No crash when loading UI with telnet connected
